    <h1 class="heading">Impact of Artificial Intelligence on human jobs</h1>

    <h2 class="subheading">What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">If you ask this question, I will assume that you are living in a cave in amazon forest for the last 24 months.But for understanding , here is the definition of AI given by AI itself</p>
    <p style="color:blue" class="paragraph">"AI, or artificial intelligence, refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, reason, and perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. It involves the development of computer systems that can analyze and interpret data, learn from experiences, make decisions, and adapt to new situations."</p>
    <h2 class="subheading">What do popular people say on AI impact?</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">Twitter C.E.O Elon musk if warning about the dangers of AI from the very start of AI boom.In his views until AI is used for good purposes and it is not much adavanved it is safe, once it crosses the limits it can destroy human race.Same concerns are raised by many AI start up founders.vladimir putin said "Whoever becomes the leader in AI will become the ruler of the world" . Putin highlights the geopolitical implications of AI development and the potential for AI to conquer the world.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Stephen Hawkings expressed his views as the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race. Hawking warned about the risks of developing advanced AI without proper research on how to control it.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Geoffrey Hinton, the "godfather of AI," resigned from Google in May 2023. He made concerns about the potential dangers of AI, including the spread of false information,loss of jobs, and the risk of creating  truly intelligent machines which are even more smarter than humans.</p>
    <h2 class="subheading">Positive impact of AI</h2>
    <img src="aiimage1.webp" class="chatgptimage"/>
    <p class="paragraph">I belive that Artificial Intelligence has the capability of creatinh a huge number new jobs in different sectors.It can revolutionise the entire job market.AI can replace humans and automate repetitive works giving a chance for humans to shuft their work into complex tasks.Which improves the quality of work and production.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p class="paragraph">A 2019 study by the McKinsey Global Institute found that AI could add $13 trillion to the global economy by 2030. The study found that AI could boost productivity in a wide range of industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, and financial services.</p></li>
        <li><p class="paragraph">A 2021 study by the Brookings Institution found that AI could help to reduce poverty and inequality. The study found that AI could be used to improve healthcare, education, and access to financial services in developing countries.</p></li>
        <li><p class="paragraph">A 2020 study by the World Economic Forum found that AI could create 95 million new jobs by 2025. The study found that AI could create new jobs in areas such as data analytics, machine learning, and robotics.</p></li>
        <li><p class="paragraph">A 2022 study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies found that AI could help to address climate change. The study found that AI could be used to develop more efficient energy sources, reduce food waste, and improve water management.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="subheading">Negative impact of AI</h2>
    <img src="aiimage2.png" class="chatgptimage"/>
    <p class="paragraph">New autonomous weapons can be created using AI which can be a serious threat to humanity if they become out of control or hacked by terrorists.AI could take human jobs such as call center employees, psychologists and nursing assistants.If AI and robotics are combined, then it would be more worse. AI requires a lot of energy and the production of this energy can be harmful to the environment.If AI systems become more and more powerful, there will be a time where we can not have control over them and they may take decisions which are not in our intrests.</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="paragraph">A 2019 study by the McKinsey Global Institute found that up to 800 million jobs could be lost to automation by 2030.</li>
        <li class="paragraph">A 2020 study by the University of Oxford found that AI systems are biased against people from developing countries.</li>
        <li class="paragraph">A 2021 study by the Brookings Institution found that 40% of jobs in the United States are at risk of being automated by 2030.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="subheading">How advanced is AI?</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">Currently AI is in the initial stages but is advanced. Like AI is used in self driving cars which can navigate without human control. We can get a good understanding on this by seeing examples like Geoffrey Hinton's resignation from google AI department due to rapid advancements in the field which may cause a situation where AI can get out of human control and moves against humans.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Another example is  Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak signed on an open letter which is also signed by more than 2,600 tech industry leaders and researchers. This open letter called for a temporary stop of research and development of AI.The petition shared concerns that AI competiting human intelligence can be a very big threat to the human race. It urged all AI companies to immediately stop developing AI systems that are more potent than GPT-4 for at least six months. GPT-4 is a large language model created by OpenAI — the fourth in its GPT series.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">From these two cases we can understand how smarter and advanced the AI is.</p>
    <h2 class="subheading">Historical example when same situations arised.</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">In 1961, President Kennedy said, “the major challenge of the sixties is to maintain full employment at a time when automation is replacing men.” In the 1980s, growth of usage of personal computers caused "computerphobia" causing people to fear of computers would replace them. But it did not happen , infact computers created even more number of jobs than were destroyed.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Before printers are invented, people used to write book on their own in required number of copies. There are several problems in that. printers made the work easy and replaced those writers. But printing industry created many jobs from manufacturing of printers, ink to news paper industries. Printers overcomed the barriers of time and hand writing. Thus making people lives comfortable and easy.</p>
    <h2 class="subheading">Conclusion</h2>
    <img src="developer.png" class="devimage"/>
    <p class="paragraph">Analysing all the similar  cases from history where a new technology comes into light and people fearing of job loss but the reverse happens that the technology creating more new jobs than destroyed. It all depends on the mindset of people. For example if you adopt and use that technology you will gain new skills and your job will be safe or else you will loose your job. At last</p>
    <h3 class="aih3">"AI will not replace you, but a person using AI will."</h3>
