    <h1 class="heading">What can 365 days do?</h1>
    <p class="paragraph">Hey guys in this blog I am going to describe my one year coding journey. Exactly one year before on 16-november-2022 I have joined in college . Before joining college I have zero knowledge on how to use computer . I have to ask my brother how to shut down my laptop. </p>

       <p class="paragraph"> Let me tell me a story. Before joining college i wanted to know what a programming language is so I went to a neighbours house who knows a little bit of programming we started to write for adding two numbers in java. It took us 2 hours to write that code even after googling it.</p>

       <h2 class="subheading">My journey of learning python:</h2>
       <p class="paragraph">I came to college on 7-nov-2022 we had ten days till classes start on 16-nov. Out of enthusiasm I wanted to learn python. To learn that I took one of my previous school seniors next wave account I was allotted a room in 4th floor in meenachil hotel in iiit kottayam. At that time wifi is not available in hostel. and phones didn’t get any signals in our hostel. One day I got to know that in ground floor in one room wifi is coming and luckily it was my friends room. There started my journey of python.  I that room only in one place wifi works. I used to sit there for the whole day with worst wifi speed and learned python. At that time I don’t even know how to use an IDE I used to run a different file other than the required , with the help of my cousin and some youtube videos I figured it out. In that 10 days I have learnt python upto oops. By then my college started and hostel had new wifi for entire hostel .</p>

        <h2 class="subheading">Starting with competitive programming: </h2>
        <p class="paragraph">My cousin introduced the term ‘competitive programming’ to me that was one of the best thing that happened to me. I have started with code chef . I tried to solve problems in python but i don’t know the difference between pypy and pyth3 I used to submit my code in python in pypy section it gave me errors. It took a lot of time for me to figure it out in that process i made many friends.</p>

        <h2 class="subheading">What have i done in this year:</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Learnt 4 programming languages c, c++ , python , java and basics of php (in which i forgot c, java, python), Explored web dev started with html, css which are in my first semester, I made many websites one for my fathers business , one for my portfolio and corned many websites. At this point i found web development interesting and spent much time on it in this process i learnt MY SQL also. Then one day i came across an instagram story asking for people who want to take part in development of an app. This is the second best thing happened to me this year. I joined that group where i met many great developers one of then is Varun, he asked me to learn VUE JS and then i learnt the basics of it (upto routing). Then I came to my second semester and started Data structures , slowly I lost interest in wen dev and shifted every thing into Data structures. I have solved a lot of problems in various online platforms and started competitive programming seriously. But I was late compared to my friends who are doing cp from their school days. My second semester completed and it was just 3 months long. 
            I couldn’t give my full commitment to competitive programming which i regret. My third semester started and I am now into algorithms. I learnt different approaches to solve a problem like greedy, Dynamic programming. Im this time i fell in love with algorithms especially with recursion, I can feel satisfaction when I write a recursion. Apart  from this play badminton , I have participated in intra IIITK 
            sports meet 2022(only badminton) and 2023( badminton , volleyball, cricket). I also play mobile game a lot. I used to watch english movies daily in free time to understand fast English.
            That’s it for this year</p>

        <h2 class="subheading">A lesson from this 365 days:</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">I have learnt a lot and hustled a lot. Actually I don’t believe in these 6- month transformations and all if somebody asked me if I can do all these in one year I have said no but the things are miraculously done. If a below-average student who couldn’t clear jee and can do these from a tier-2 college then you can do even more. Just give time. I valuable thing I learnt is living 100 kgs for 10 days can’t give you a six pack but living 10 kgs for 100 days can give you six pack.</p>
        <h1 class="aih3">I hope my next 365 days goes better than these.</h1>
